/**
 * This class defines six categories of operations upon byte buffers:
 *
 *  1. Absolute and relative get and put methods that read and write single bytes;
 *  2. Relative bulk get methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from
 *     this buffer into an array;
 *  3. Relative bulk put methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from
 *     a byte array or some other byte buffer into this buffer;
 *  4. Absolute and relative get and put methods that read and write values of other
 *     primitive types, translating them to and from sequences of bytes in a
 *     particular byte order;
 *  5. Methods for creating view buffers, which allow a byte buffer to be viewed as
 *     a buffer containing values of some other primitive type; and
 *  6. Methods for compacting, duplicating, and slicing a byte buffer.
 *
 * Byte buffers can be created either by allocation, which allocates space for the
 * buffer's content, or by wrapping an existing byte array into a buffer.
 *
 * Access to binary data:
 *
 * This class defines methods for reading and writing values of all other primitive
 * types, except boolean. Primitive values are translated to (or from) sequences of
 * bytes according to the buffer's current byte order.
 *
 * For access to heterogeneous binary data, that is, sequences of values of
 * different types, this class defines a family of absolute and relative get and
 * put methods for each type. For 32-bit floating-point values, for example, this
 * class defines:
 *
 *   float getFloat()
 *   float getFloat(int index)
 *   void  putFloat(float f)
 *   void  putFloat(int index, float f)
 *
 * Corresponding methods are defined for the types char, short, int, long, and
 * double. The index parameters of the absolute get and put methods are in terms
 * of bytes rather than of the type being read or written.
 *
 * For access to homogeneous binary data, that is, sequences of values of the same
 * type, this class defines methods that can create views of a given byte buffer.
 * A view buffer is simply another buffer whose content is backed by the byte buffer.
 * Changes to the byte buffer's content will be visible in the view buffer, and vice
 * versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values are independent. The
 * asFloatBuffer method, for example, creates an instance of the FloatBuffer class
 * that is backed by the byte buffer upon which the method is invoked. Corresponding
 * view-creation methods are defined for the types char, short, int, long, and double.
 *
 * View buffers have two important advantages over the families of type-specific
 * get and put methods described above:
 *
 *   A view buffer is indexed not in terms of bytes but rather in terms of the
 *   type-specific size of its values;
 *
 *   A view buffer provides relative bulk get and put methods that can transfer
 *   contiguous sequences of values between a buffer and an array or some other
 *   buffer of the same type; and
 *
